There's one other property to take into account here: PrimaryKey. If that property is set to either DBProvidedPK or UserProvidedPK, it the templates disregard the setting for DataAccess. 
The reasoning is that depending on the type of primary key you choose, it needs to be readonly, or createonly, but also needs to be used as a param for update and delete. So, in short, properties that are reflect the identity of the object need to have a special treatment.
