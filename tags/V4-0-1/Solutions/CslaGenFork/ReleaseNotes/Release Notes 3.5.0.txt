Release Notes for version 3.0.5.0



A) Introduction
---------------

The numbering of versions reflects the latest Csla version supported (as of August 2009) - the last digit is used 
for releases.

Csla 3.0.5 can run under Framework .NET 2.0 or Framework .NET 3.0 according to the NET20 compiler symbol 
(http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&id=ac20fe4c-6afc-4176-bcb4-d74b5a370356).

This fork is based on CslaGen build 20071009.



B) Differences to the base CslaGen build
----------------------------------------

GENERAL

1. Drop the versioning by build and use version numbers.

2. Add an "About" window reporting the version number (design based on CslaGen 20090529).

3. Cleanup the start page: added a red "Fork" to the image, deleted outdated references and added links to 
Code Project articles and samples.

4. Added a UnitTest project.

5. Small changes:
- startup form shows the project name on the form title area (updated on open, new, save, save as and generate)
- startup form "CSLAgen" renamed to "MainForm"
- upper cased "CSLA" was mostly converted to "Csla"
- AccesorVisibility renamed to AccessorVisibility
- ParentTypeEditor only show collection stereotypes in the ParentType combo box
- item and parent combo boxes select available objects using Relation Rules Engine
- old stuff moved to a solution folder, etc.



Template changes were made to C# 2.0 and also to sprocs (sorry, I'm a noob on VB).


TEMPLATES

6. "Templates" folder is inside the VS2008 solution and gets copied to the output folder on compile. 
The old "Templates" was renamed "TemplateHelpers". (Editing templates and having to keep two folders synchronized 
wasn't a pratical proposition.)

7. All Sprocs and C# 2.0 templates are in Windows format (\r\n) (Visual Studio was complaining about it all the time).

8. All source code, sprocs and C# 2.0 templates are free of Tab characters (CSLA 1.0 and VB for 2.0 may contain 
Tabs or "\t").

9. Templates for sprocs and C# 2.0 were cleaned up as much as possible in order to get correct (near 100%) indentation 
and correct line spacing around region marks. Trailing spaces were also cleaned up.

10. The template for generating the file header now includes a file with CslaGenFork version.

11. Created "Warnings" template string property to log non fatal errors. The "Errors" property is to be used only when it's impossible to 
complete the template run. CslaGen generates as much code as it can but this separation avoids most of generation exceptions.

12. Added checks:
- use Relation Rules Engine for template runtime checks
12.1. Collection item checks - on all collection types (except for NVL):
- the item type property is specified
- the item type exists
- the parent type of the collection's item is specified
- the parent type of the collection's item matches the current collection name
- the object type of the collection's item type is compatible with the collection object type (Relation Rules Engine)
12.2. Collection parent checks (ReadOnlyObject, EditableChild, EditableSwitchable and DynamicEditableRoot)
- the parent type property is specified (only on EditableSwitchable and DynamicEditableRoot)
- the parent type exists (if specified)
- the item type of the parent collection is specified
- the item type of the parent collection matches the current item name
- the object type of the parent collection is compatible with the item object type (Relation Rules Engine)
12.3. Non-collection checks
- EditableChild and EditableChildCollection parent type is specified (no checks on parent object type)


MOST IMPORTANT

13. Added support for generate System.Threading.Interlocked.Decrement(ref _lastID) as default property value.
Provided the PrimaryKey is DBProvidedPK you enter _lastID (case insensitive) and PropertyType is an integer (16/32/64), 
the template will replace _lastID with "System.Threading.Interlocked.Decrement(ref _lastID)" and 
will create a static _lastID field.

14. Added "onInsertStart" and "onUpdateStart" events in order to allow setting the changed user and changed date/time 
for auditing (there was no other way to set those values before DoInsertUpdate is executed).

15. Value properties have a new "FKConstraint" property that generates the appropriate INNER JOINs.
Example: on the Docs table you set the DbBindColumn to the DocTypeID and then convert it somehow to the "doc type name"; 
now you can set the DbBindColumn to the DocTypeName column of the DocTypes table and CslaGenFork does all the work for you.

16. Csla 2.0+ only - CslaGen generates an internal/Friend static/NotInheritable class "Database" that reads normal app.config settings for 
the main database and also for the security database. The location of that file is defined on the 
"New Object Defaults" tab of the project options (the folder is created if it doesn't exist). Generation of this file can 
be switched off on "Generation" tab. There is only one database class file and the generation process will never overwrite it.

17. Created a Relation Rules Engine (unit tests added) to check parent/child, collection/item relations 
(used in template runtime checks and combo box population).

18. Support for DynamicEditableRoot and DynamicEditableRootCollection Csla stereotypes.

19. Support for "convert value properties" - properties that doesn't exist on the database and are convert from/to other 
properties. This is intend for converting IDs to human readable descriptions using NVL objects (doesn't apply to 
collections and NameValueList).

20. Support for "update value properties" - properties of an object that get updated on a Saved event triggered by an 
editable object. This is intended for updating a ReadOnlyList of info objects when a corresponding root object gets updated 
(OnSaved event may be generated by EditableRoot, EditableSwitchable and DynamicEditableRoot; only ReadOnlyCollection/ReadOnlyObject 
may handle the event).

TO DO

-> separate Warning and FATAL errors - on going

-> move the template folder to another location - make a setting for templates path



C) Temporary solutions to CSLA.NET shortcomings
-----------------------------------------------

CSLA.NET type "Editable Root List Base" (ERLB) is CslaGen type "DynamicEditableRootCollection". CSLA.NET doesn't define the 
Initialize() signature (it's on Rocky's todo list and should be solved on version 4)

The problems
- VS2008 says "there is no suitable method to override"
- we can't use standard CslaGen automatic support for DataPortal events

The solutions
- the template omits "override" for DynamicEditableRootCollection objects
- the template adds an explicit call to this.Initialize() for DynamicEditableRootCollection objects

These template changes must be reversed for future CSLA.NET with this problem solved.
